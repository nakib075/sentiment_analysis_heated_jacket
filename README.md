Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis, often known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) method for identifying the positivity, negativity, or neutrality of data. Businesses often do sentiment analysis on textual data to track the perception of their brands and products in customer reviews and to better understand their target market.

Sentiment Classification. 
Sentiment classification is the process of finding the polarity of each subjective sentence. The strength of an opinion is referred to as its polarity. It might be both beneficial and bad. If anything is connected with a strong good sensation or emotion, such as admiration, trust, or love, it will indeed have a particular orientation towards all other parts of that object's existence. The same is true of negative polarities. 'I don't believe I'll buy this thing because my prior experience with a similar item wasn't very nice,' for example. This has a negative polarity. First, there are rule-based systems that categorize a specific piece of text using a dictionary of words and rules. Second, there are systems that utilize machine learning methods to examine a corpus of texts that have previously been classified (usually positively or negatively) and predict the classification of a new text based on this. The well-known Python package NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) makes use of machine learning methods, while Textblob, another NLP toolkit, offers both kinds. Sentiment scores -1.0, 0, and 1.0 usually determine the negative, neutral, and positive, respectively, polarity of the text.
